# FastAPI

## Introduction
What if you want to integrate your machine learning model into a larger software solution instead of a simple standalone web application (in this case streamlit would suffice)? What if you are working alongside a software engineer who is building a large application and needs to access your model through a REST API? This exactly where FastAPI comes into play.

## What is FastAPI?
FastAPI is a Python web framework that makes it easy for developers to build fast (high-performance), production-ready REST APIs. If youâ€™re a data scientist who works mostly with Python, FastAPI is an excellent tool for deploying your models as REST APIs.
