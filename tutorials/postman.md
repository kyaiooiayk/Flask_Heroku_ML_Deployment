# Postman
***

## Introduction
- Postman is a very simple and intuitive API testing tool or application. 
- Postman helps to build, test and modify APIs. Almost any functionality that could be needed by any developer is encapsulated in this tool.
- It has a user-friendly GUI that we can send HTTP requests through. It allows us to send requests with different HTTP methods (that is, GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE) and we can check the response from the server.
***

## Installation
Donwload the native App [here](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
***

## HTTP methods 
- In POSTMAN we got many methods but we use only `GET`, `PUT`, `POST` and `DELETE`:
  - `POST` – This Call creates a new entity.
  - `GET` – This call sends the request and receives the response.
  - `PUT` – This call creates a new entity and updates the existing entity.
  - `DELETE` – This call deletes the existing entity.

## Swagger vs. Postman
- Swagger is another HTTP Client tool where we create API documentation and through swagger, we can also hit the API and get the response.
- You Can use either Swagger or POSTMAN to test the APIs, and it depends on companies as which client to use.
