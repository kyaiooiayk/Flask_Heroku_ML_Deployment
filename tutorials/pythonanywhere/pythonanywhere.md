# Pythonanywhere
***

## What is it?
- PythonAnywhere makes it easy to create and run Python programs in the cloud. You can write your programs in a web-based editor or just run a console session from any modern web browser. There's storage space on our servers, and you can preserve your session state and access it from anywhere, with no need to pay for, or configure, your own server. Start work on your work desktop, then later pick up from where you left off by accessing exactly the same session from your laptop. 
- In this respository most of the topics are related to ML models deployment.

### CPU-only
- If you are planning to use pythonanywhere to host your ML application, keep in mind that inference must be done on CPU-only as GPU-inferece are not offered at the time of writing.
