# AWS S3

## What is AWS S3?
-  Amazon S3 is a key-value, object-based storage service.
- Amazon S3 organizes objects into buckets; bucket names must be globally unique.
- Objects can be uploaded to Amazon S3 buckets using the AWS management console or the AWS CLI.
- You can control access to both buckets and the objects in buckets.
- Each object in Amazon S3 has a storage class associated with it. The storage class deter- mines how Amazon S3 stores the data for the object and if you will be charged additional costs to read the data.
- Amazon S3 versioning allows you to save multiple versions of an object. You are charged for the combined space occupied by all versions of a document.
