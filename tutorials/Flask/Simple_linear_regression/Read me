This project has four parts :

1) model.py — This contains code for the machine learning model to predict sales in the third month based on the sales in the first two months.

2) app.py — This contains Flask APIs that receives sales details through GUI or API calls, computes the predicted value based on our model and returns it.

3) request.py — This uses requests module to call APIs defined in app.py and displays the returned value.

4) HTML/CSS — This contains the HTML template and CSS styling to allow user to enter sales detail and displays the predicted sales in the third month.

To run the code simply type:
python app.py
