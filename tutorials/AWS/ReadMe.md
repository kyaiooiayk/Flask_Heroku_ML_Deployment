# AWS Amazon Web Server

## Quick references
- **Elastic Inference** allows you to attach low-cost GPU-powered acceleration to Amazon EC2 and Sagemaker instances or Amazon ECS tasks, to reduce the cost of running deep learning inference by up to 75%. Amazon Elastic Inference supports TensorFlow, Apache MXNet, PyTorch and ONNX models.
- **S3 bucket** stand for Simple Storage Service (S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Customers of all sizes and industries can use Amazon S3 to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as data lakes, websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics
- **SageMaker** is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly. It provides the tools to build, train and deploy machine learning (ML) models for predictive analytics applications. The platform automates the tedious work of building a production-ready artificial intelligence (AI) pipeline.
