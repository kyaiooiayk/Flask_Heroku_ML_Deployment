# DVC (Data Version Control)

## What is DVC?
- DVC is open-source.
- Interact perfectly with Git and the combination Git/DVC is one of the most popular choice for simple versioning.
- DVC works by supplementing each data file with a corresponding metadata file (.dvc), which is used to sync with a remote repository designed for large files (e.g., AWS). Git tracks the metadata file, while DVC handles the remote repository.
