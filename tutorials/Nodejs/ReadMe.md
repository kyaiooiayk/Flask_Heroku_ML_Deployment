# Node.js
***

## Introduction
- In simple terms, it’s a JavaScript free and open source cross-platform for server-side programming that allows users to build network applications quickly.
- It’s a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. This is what make node.js so fast.
- Uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it light weight & efficient. What is event-driven programming? The flow of your program is defined by the events that are taking place. (see below for more details). Blocking methods execute synchronously and non-blocking methods execute asynchronously. 
- NodeJS is not a framework and it’s not a programming language.

## Difference between Node.js and Express.js
- **Node.js** is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript.
- **Express.js** is a framework based on Node.js for which is used for building web-application using approaches and principles of Node.js.event-driven.
