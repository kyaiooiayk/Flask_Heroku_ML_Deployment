# Heroku
***

## What is it?
- Heroku is **PAAS** (Platform as a service app) which enables developers to deploy their applications on the web and it does offer a free plan!

## More info
- You just need to add two special files requirements.txt and Procfile(without any extensions).
- Basically Procfile tells heroku about a set of processes/commands that needs to be run beforehand, the Procfile looks something like this.
- This is the step you need to follow to send your app to a public server:
  - Train model
  - Crete a web app via Flask
  - Commit code to github
  - Create an account with Heroku
  - Linkgithub to Heroku
  - Deploy the mode
  - Web is ready to use
