- "Lightweight", "Python" and "Minimal" are the key factors why developers consider Flask; whereas "Components", "Virtual dom" and "Performance" are the primary reasons why React is favoured.
- If you want to be a Web developer with knowledge in another frontend and NoSql technology, maybe continue with Flask. However, if you want to create very fast solutions to grow up with a new business and merge these with data analysis and other tools, Django is the answer. Basically read more about the service architecture where you feel more comfortable, Microservice or Monolithic, but please will not married with any because they solve issues to different contexts
