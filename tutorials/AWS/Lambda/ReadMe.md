# AWS Lambda

## What is a serverless lambda?
AWS Lambda is the only Amazon compute option that remains free after one year. It’s also arguably the best option for a service that will scale smoothly to handle thousands, millions, or billions of requests. Choosing Lambda from the beginning sets your application up for success in the future. Pay attention that this is AWS services in the free tier come with a limit, usually enforced each month. Some of these seem impossibly large like AWS Lambda’s grant of one million function calls. A million can come pretty soon if you’re not careful, so make sure you actually monitor this.
