## Introduction
- MLflow is an open source project that offers experiment tracking and multiframe‐work support including Apache Spark, but limited workflow support. 
- If you need a lightweight, simple way to track experiments and run simple workflows, this may be a good choice.
- MLflow has more to offer than just experiment tracking: this versatile framework also includes features such as MLflow Projects, the Model Registry, and built-in deployment options.
