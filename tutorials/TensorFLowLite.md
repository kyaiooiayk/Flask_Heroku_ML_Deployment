# TensorFlow Lite

- TensorFlow Lite is a suite of tools that complements TensorFlow, achieving two main goals. The first is to make your models mobile-friendly. 
- This often involves reducing their size and complexity, with as little impact as possible on their accuracy, to make them work better in a battery-constrained environment like a mobile device. The sec‚Äê ond is to provide a runtime for different mobile platforms, including Android, iOS, mobile Linux (for example, Raspberry Pi), and various microcontrollers. Note that you cannot train a model with TensorFlow Lite. 
- Your workflow will be to train it using TensorFlow and then convert it to the TensorFlow Lite format, before loading and running it using a TensorFlow Lite interpreter.
