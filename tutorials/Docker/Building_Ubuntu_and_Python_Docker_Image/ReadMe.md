# Building an Ubuntu and Python Docker Image
*This section illustrates the building of a Docker image based on the latest version of Ubuntu. *
***

To this end, two scripts are needed:
  - One is a bash script named `install.sh` that does all the work on the Linux level. \
  - The other is a Docker file  nammed `Dockerfile` which controls the building procedure for the image itself.
