- [Kubernets | [Notes](https://github.com/kyaiooiayk/MLOps-Machine-Learning-Operations/tree/master/tutorials/Kubernetes)]

### Application Framework/Model Deployment
- Django
- Flask
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- React
- Nginx
- Redis

### Cloud computing
Cloud computing is a name which refers to cluster machines on the cloud. AWS, seems to be the most popular. Maybe if one has to choose, one would look  at the one allowing more free computing hrs.
- AWS (Amazon Web Server)
- Microsoft Azure
- GCP (Google Cloud Platform)

### Relational Database
RDB (relational database) is a database that stores data into tables with rows and columns.

### Relational database at scale
How to turn SQL-like into a map-reduce job that can run on a distributed file system. This is essentiallu what we mean by relational database at scale.
- [Hive | [Notes](https://github.com/kyaiooiayk/MLOps-Machine-Learning-Operations/blob/master/tutorials/Hive.md)] (twice as popular as Pig and developed by Facebook). Hive provides SQL type querying language for the ETL purpose on top of Hadoop file system. 
- Pig (less popular than Hive)

### Non relational database
 - MongoDB
 - CosmosDB

### Data warehouse tools
- Looker
- Stitch
- DBT
- Snowflake
- Amazon redshift
- Azure synapse
- Google big query

###  Management 
It is an unified analytics platform.
- Databricks 
- AWS google
- MS has its own alternative

### Streaming
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Google Dataflow
