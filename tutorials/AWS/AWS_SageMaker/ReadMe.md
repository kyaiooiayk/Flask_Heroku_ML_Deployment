# AWS SageMaker

## Introduction
- It is a fully managed web service that provides the ability to explore data, engineer features, and train machine learning models on AWS cloud infrastructure using Python code.
- It provides implementations of a number of cloud-optimized versions of machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, factorization machines, and PCA.
- It provides the ability to create your own algorithms based on popular frameworks such as Scikit-learn, Google TensorFlow, and Apache MXNet.
- It provides a convenient high-level, object-oriented interface for Python developers.
- A SageMaker notebook instances are EC2 instances in your account that come preconfigured with a Jupyter Notebook server, and a number of common Python libraries.
- Training jobs create dedicated compute instances in the AWS cloud that contain model- building code, load your training data from Amazon S3, execute the model-building code on your training data, and save the trained model to Amazon S3.
- When the training job is complete, the compute instances that were provisioned to support the training process will automatically be terminated.
