# TensorFlow Serving

- Models can be deployed on Android and iOS, and in the web browser. 
- Another obvious place where models can be deployed is to a server, so that your users can pass data to your server and have it run inference using your model and return the results. 
- This can be achieved using TensorFlow Serving, a simple “wrapper” for models that provides an API surface as well as production-level scalability.
